#Project1-Tic_Tac_Toe
by Christopher Smith

The classic pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe adapted to the internet!
If you wish to play against the computer, enter 1 when prompted for number of players.
You will be in for a challenge, the computer player is rather difficult to beat!!!
If you wish to play against a friend, enter 2 when prompted for number of players.
Regardless of amount of players, you can keep playing as long as you wish, it will automatically reset the game when completed. You will only need to refresh the page when switching between single or multi-player modes.
